## Introduction  ![racing-flag](https://github.com/JasleenKaur2711/BlindMate/assets/117057315/ee9b7e79-c965-42b1-8bbf-3d6e2ff433c4)


Welcome to BlindMate â€“ your smart accessibility assistant designed to transform the lives of visually impaired individuals. Our project is driven by a deep-rooted desire to make the world a more inclusive and accessible place for everyone. We believe that technology has the power to bridge gaps, and it's this belief that inspired us to embark on this journey.

## The Inspiration  ![thought-leadership](https://github.com/JasleenKaur2711/BlindMate/assets/117057315/45360273-0ed8-446c-aa31-d89ab5c09da1)

Imagine a world where people with visual impairments can independently navigate their surroundings, identify objects, access information effortlessly, and even recognize currency notes. The inspiration for BlindMate comes from a profound understanding of the challenges faced by visually impaired individuals on a daily basis, coupled with the realization that technology can be a game-changer.

## Relating Real-World   ![research](https://github.com/JasleenKaur2711/BlindMate/assets/117057315/8aa799db-afb4-4ec3-865b-6f7a8496c54c)


#### Empowering Independence

Our inspiration draws from countless stories of individuals who are determined to live life to the fullest despite their visual impairments. People like Stevie Wonder and Haben Girma have shown us the incredible potential that can be unlocked when accessibility barriers are removed.

#### Innovative Solutions 

The rise of smart devices and AI has paved the way for innovative accessibility solutions. BlindMate is inspired by projects like "Be My Eyes," an app connecting blind users with sighted volunteers for real-time assistance, and "Seeing AI" from Microsoft, which uses AI to provide detailed descriptions of the visual world.

#### Impactful Research: Studies like "The Impact of Technology on Blind and Visually Impaired People" have underscored the importance of technological advancements in enhancing the quality of life for visually impaired individuals.

## Our Vision  ![idea](https://github.com/JasleenKaur2711/BlindMate/assets/117057315/74b5e4c6-81eb-47f8-bd32-a90d9c68676e)

At BlindMate, our vision is to empower visually impaired individuals with a tool that not only assists them in their daily activities but also enhances their confidence and autonomy. Through cutting-edge technologies like image recognition, voice commands, and AI-driven text-to-speech conversion, we aim to create an inclusive environment where the visually impaired can navigate, explore, and engage with the world around them.

## What BlindMate Does?  ![shrug](https://github.com/JasleenKaur2711/BlindMate/assets/117057315/2cc3e9b2-9c4b-4606-a91e-38af318b78d4)

BlindMate is a comprehensive smart accessibility assistant that offers a range of features to empower visually impaired individuals:

#### Object and Scene Recognition 
BlindMate uses advanced image recognition techniques to identify and describe objects and scenes captured by smartphone cameras. Users receive detailed auditory descriptions of their surroundings.

#### Currency Recognition
BlindMate can accurately recognize and identify various currency notes. Users can simply capture an image of a currency note, and BlindMate will provide an auditory description of the note's denomination.

#### Text-to-Speech Conversion
BlindMate converts text in images to natural-sounding speech, providing instant access to printed information. This feature proves invaluable for reading labels, signs, and other textual content.

#### Voice Commands
Users can interact with BlindMate using voice commands, enabling hands-free navigation and information retrieval. Whether it's identifying objects or requesting specific information, BlindMate is ready to assist.

## How I Built It?  ![build](https://github.com/JasleenKaur2711/BlindMate/assets/117057315/e499708d-894c-4503-87eb-a78c5cd110be)

Building BlindMate involved a step-by-step approach to harness the power of technology for accessibility:

#### Import Libraries
We leveraged essential libraries like TensorFlow, OpenCV, and oneDNN (Intel oneAPI library) to enable efficient deep learning operations and accelerate performance.

#### Understand the Data
We curated a diverse dataset of Indian currency notes, ensuring a comprehensive representation of denominations and variations.

#### Train the Data
We trained our models using various architectures, optimizing their performance with oneDNN to achieve faster inference without compromising accuracy.

#### Test and Refine
We rigorously tested the models using real-world images and refined their parameters for optimal results.

#### Save the Model
Once satisfied, we saved the trained model, making it ready for integration into the BlindMate application.

## What I Learnt From This Project  ![study](https://github.com/JasleenKaur2711/BlindMate/assets/117057315/76a0488d-61d2-4437-abd1-77b1a80bce54)

Working on BlindMate was an enlightening experience that taught us valuable lessons:

#### Empathy-Driven Innovation
Accessibility technology isn't just about code; it's about understanding the needs of users and designing solutions that genuinely empower them.

#### Optimization Matters
Integrating oneDNN significantly enhanced our models' performance, showcasing the importance of optimizing deep learning operations.

#### Collaboration and Impact
By collaborating across disciplines, we saw how technology can drive positive impact and make a meaningful difference in people's lives.

#### Continuous Learning
The project's complexity challenged us to expand our knowledge, pushing us to explore cutting-edge techniques and stay updated with the latest advancements.
